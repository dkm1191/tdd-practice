	/**
	 * The theatric warm-up game 'Fizz Buzz' is played by the players forming a circle and in turn simply counting up, except:
	 * - if a number is divisable by 3 (e.g. 6) -or contains a 3- (e.g. 13)- in stead the player says "Fizz"
	 * - if a number is divisable by 5 (e.g. 20) -or contains a 5 (e.g. 25)- in stead the player says "Buzz"
	 * - if both rules above apply, the player says "FizzBuzz"
	 *
	 * A player is out if he fails to say the correct number or fails to substitute a candidate.
	 * (Of course, a player is also out if his answer starts with "Dizz"...)
	 *
	 * Implement the perfect player that, given a number, correctly returns the number, "Fizz", "Buzz" or "FizzBuzz" respectively
	 *
	 * Examples
	 * 1 -> "1"
	 * 3 -> "Fizz"
	 * 5 -> "Buzz"
	 * 15 -> "FizzBuzz"
	 *
	 * Optional:
	 * Do the same for number ending in 3 or 5

	 * We are going to work in a particular piece for a search engine. The engine is intended to search
	 * for professionals within a given area. Users will do queries like “list the Java developers in
	 * Berlin”, expecting to find a list of people’s profiles.
	 * This exercise is divided into multiple component, each developed separately.
	 *
	 * PART 1: PARSER
	 * develop a parser that normalizes search input into something our search engine can work with
	 * - remove plurals, e.g. cooks --> cook
	 * - capitalize inputs, e.g. cook --> COOK
	 * - remove diacritics, e.g. CÔÖK -> COOK

	/**
	 * (a.k.a. FizzBuzz)
	 *
	 * The theatric warm-up game 'Fuzzy Ducky' is played by the players forming a circle and in turn simply counting up, except:
	 * - if a number is divisable by 3 (e.g. 6) or contains a 3 (e.g. 13) in stead the player says "Fuzzy"
	 * - if a number is divisable by 7 (e.g. 14) or contains a 7 (e.g. 17) in stead the player says "Ducky"
	 * - if both rules above apply, the player says "Fuzzy Ducky"
	 *
	 * A player is out if he fails to say the correct number or fails to substitute a candidate.
	 * (Of course, a player is also out if his answer starts with "Duzzy"...)
	 *
	 * Implement the perfect player that, given a number, correctly returns the number, "fuzzy", "ducky" or "fuzzy ducky" respectively
	 *
	 * Examples
	 * 13 -> "Fuzzy"
	 * 14 -> "Ducky
	 * 15 -> "Fuzzy"
	 * 16 -> 16
	 *
	 * 27 -> "Fuzzy Ducky"
